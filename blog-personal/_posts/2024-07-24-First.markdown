This is the beginning of something new.

This site was built with a ruby framework called Jekyll, spun up on a Fedora KDE machine. The bundle will be packaged as a docker image and then pushed to github.

Then, with the use of Google Cloud services, it will be spun up dynamically and served from github by the Cloud Run configuration. The alternative option was to have a constantly-running ubuntu micro VM with nginx, but I liked the idea of trying a dynamic image instead of a permanent VM.

As of the writing of this post, the blog has not yet been deployed to the google cloud, nor has the domain been purchased and configured.
